        <h1>Asset keyboard layout</h1>

<p><a href="http://millikeys.sourceforge.net/asset/">Asset</a> is an alternative keyboard layout. It was created to introduce significant typing efficiencies over the QWERTY layout without being as difficult to learn as other alternatives like Dvorak, Colemak or Workman.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/deekayen/asset/0e220f65f477346b37e5b70b30fba845787b1a05/asset_layout.jpg" alt="Asset keyboard layout"></p>

<p>After having tried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard">Dvorak</a>, <a href="http://colemak.com">Colemak</a>, and <a href="http://www.workmanlayout.com">Workman</a>, I independently concluded the assignment of a key cap in my brain from QWERTY was stuck not only to the hand, but to the finger. When typing in Workman, I continuously typed the letter E with my left, middle finger, which is H in Workman. I thought it was unnecessary to fight my QWERTY training when a few minor modifications to QWERTY could yield significant typing efficiency improvements over QWERTY.</p>

<p>Asset also acknowledges we live in a QWERTY world. Even if users joined a popular movement to use alternate keyboard layouts, copy/paste, save, select all, and quit are common shortcuts for applications. I see copy/paste as a significant typing-saver, so shifting any of those keys around is doesn't strike me as dealing with modern realities.</p>

<h2>Layout evaluation</h2>

<p>In the circles of keyboard layouts, the <a href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/">Carpalx</a> site is well-known for its evaluation of various keyboard layouts and its trumpeting of the <a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> layout as a premier contender. In the <a href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?keyboard_layouts">Carpalx study</a>, with various, fancy calculations, it assigned QWERTY a base score of 3 and proceeded to compare other layouts, lower scores are better.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY">QWERTY</a>: 3</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a>: 2.098</li>
<li>Workman: 1.993</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.michaelcapewell.com/projects/keyboard/index.htm#The_Capewell-Dvorak_Layout">Capewell-Dvorak</a>: 1.985</li>
<li>
<a href="http://millikeys.sourceforge.net/asset/">Asset</a>: 1.894</li>
<li>Klausler: 1.867</li>
<li>
<a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>: 1.842</li>
<li>
<a href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization">QGMLWY</a>: 1.670</li>
</ul><p><img src="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/images/keyboard-cost.png" alt="Carpalx scoring model"></p>

<p>To receive a score of 0 in the Carpalx study, the alphabet would need to be reduced to 8 letters or only the home row keys would be used in the study per layout. No finger lateral finger stretching or curling movement would be permitted to get a fully optimized score. The lower the score, the less you move from the home row.</p>

<p>The Carpalx study goes on to recommend other optimizations, supposedly scoring even better than Colemak. The clearest outcome from the study is that you can use almost any layout other than QWERTY and gain significant efficiencies in your finger travel. Most major operating systems have both Dvorak and Colemak built-in.</p>

<h2>The Asset difference</h2>

<p>I theorize that users of alternative layouts are interested in dropping QWERTY because they have or are expecting to have repetitive stress injuries from using a keyboard. Certain realities of life come into play:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <strong>grid layout</strong> like <a href="http://typematrix.com/">TypeMatrix</a> is <strong>not likely to be adopted</strong> widely by computer manufacturers,</li>
<li>contoured keyboards like the <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm">Kinesis</a> are even less likely to be adopted widely,</li>
<li>keyboards with <strong>cords are dinosaurs</strong>,</li>
<li>
<strong>wireless keyboards</strong> like the <a href="http://www.frogpad.com/">FrogPad</a> with multiple parts <strong>still require significant effort</strong> to learn new typing formats,</li>
<li>
<strong>undo/copy/cut/paste, save, select all, and quit are common shortcuts</strong>, which belong on the left hand and <strong>are already in optimal locations</strong>,</li>
<li>a new keyboard layout alone won't prevent repetitive stress injuries.</li>
</ul><h3>Compromises</h3>

<p>Every layout has its strengths. The author of Workman is confident in his key cap scoring model, which if applied to U.S. English yields remarkably low effort scores, however the full optimization of Workman compromises the locations for copy/paste, putting them in less efficient locations for frequent copy operations.</p>

<p>Colemak and Asset are similar layouts, but in the design of Asset, the same-finger assignment from QWERTY is considered in the design. Though Colemak is touted for its supposed ease of switching from QWERTY, <strong>Asset keeps 20/26 letters on the same finger</strong>, whereas <strong>Colemak only keeps 15/26</strong>. As the Carpalx study shows, the theoretical loss of efficiency by keeping the QWERTY same-finger design is fractional, perhaps inconsequential.</p>

<p>The drastic movement of keys in the Dvorak layout is the main reason <a href="http://colemak.com/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ#What.27s_wrong_with_the_Dvorak_layout.3F">Colemak's FAQ</a> cites for Dvorak adoption failure.</p>

<p><strong>When switching from QWERTY</strong>, as a user who types enough to be concerned enough to switch, the loss of productivity in typing speed and in gained frustration is cause to <strong>minimize not only the general movement of key caps, but the finite movement to a different hand or finger on the same hand</strong>. Maintaining common shortcuts is essential to adoption. The better job you can do at <strong>minimizing frustration and productivity loss</strong>, the more likely <strong>a conversion away from QWERTY will be successful</strong>.</p>

<h2>Supported platforms</h2>

<p>This Github project offers Asset layout files for Mac OSX, Windows, Xorg, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris.</p>

<h2>Who should learn Asset?</h2>

<ul>
<li>People have or think they might get Repetitive strain injury (RSI) or Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).</li>
<li>Programmers and writers with wrist pain </li>
<li>Journalists, bloggers, secretaries, students, life hackers, authors.</li>
<li>Anyone who spends over 10 hours per week at the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
