It was created to introduce significant typing efficiencies over the QWERTY layout without being as difficult to learn as other alternatives like Dvorak, Colemak or Workman.\r\n\r\nAfter having tried [Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard), [Colemak](http://colemak.com), and [Workman](http://www.workmanlayout.com), I independently concluded the assignment of a key cap in my brain from QWERTY was stuck not only to the hand, but to the finger. When typing in Workman, I continuously typed the letter E with my left, middle finger, which is H in Workman. I thought it was unnecessary to fight my QWERTY training when a few minor modifications to QWERTY could yield significant typing efficiency improvements over QWERTY.\r\n\r\nAsset also acknowledges we live in a QWERTY world. Even if users joined a popular movement to use alternate keyboard layouts, copy/paste, save, select all, and quit are common shortcuts for applications. I see copy/paste as a significant typing-saver, so shifting any of those keys around is doesn't strike me as dealing with modern realities.","google":""}
