It was created to introduce significant typing efficiencies over the QWERTY layout without being as difficult to learn as other alternatives like Dvorak, Colemak or Workman.\r\n\r\n![Asset keyboard layout](https://raw.github.com/deekayen/asset/0e220f65f477346b37e5b70b30fba845787b1a05/asset_layout.jpg)\r\n\r\nAfter having tried [Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard), [Colemak](http://colemak.com), and [Workman](http://www.workmanlayout.com), I independently concluded the assignment of a key cap in my brain from QWERTY was stuck not only to the hand, but to the finger. When typing in Workman, I continuously typed the letter E with my left, middle finger, which is H in Workman. I thought it was unnecessary to fight my QWERTY training when a few minor modifications to QWERTY could yield significant typing efficiency improvements over QWERTY.\r\n\r\nAsset also acknowledges we live in a QWERTY world. Even if users joined a popular movement to use alternate keyboard layouts, copy/paste, save, select all, and quit are common shortcuts for applications. I see copy/paste as a significant typing-saver, so shifting any of those keys around is doesn't strike me as dealing with modern realities.\r\n\r\n## Supported platforms\r\n\r\nThis Github project offers Asset layout files for Mac OSX, Windows, Xorg, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris.\r\n\r\n# Other layouts\r\n\r\n * [Norman](http://norman.deekayen.net)\r\n * [Workman](http://workman.deekayen.net)"}
