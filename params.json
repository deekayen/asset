It was created to introduce significant typing efficiencies over the QWERTY layout without being as difficult to learn as other alternatives like Dvorak, Colemak or Workman.\r\n\r\n![Asset keyboard layout](https://raw.github.com/deekayen/asset/0e220f65f477346b37e5b70b30fba845787b1a05/asset_layout.jpg)\r\n\r\nAfter having tried [Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard), [Colemak](http://colemak.com), and [Workman](http://www.workmanlayout.com), I independently concluded the assignment of a key cap in my brain from QWERTY was stuck not only to the hand, but to the finger. When typing in Workman, I continuously typed the letter E with my left, middle finger, which is H in Workman. I thought it was unnecessary to fight my QWERTY training when a few minor modifications to QWERTY could yield significant typing efficiency improvements over QWERTY.\r\n\r\nAsset also acknowledges we live in a QWERTY world. Even if users joined a popular movement to use alternate keyboard layouts, copy/paste, save, select all, and quit are common shortcuts for applications. I see copy/paste as a significant typing-saver, so shifting any of those keys around is doesn't strike me as dealing with modern realities.\r\n\r\n## Layout evaluation\r\n\r\nIn the circles of keyboard layouts, the [Carpalx](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/) site is well-known for its evaluation of various keyboard layouts and its trumpeting of the [Colemak](http://colemak.com/) layout as a premier contender. In the [Carpalx study](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?keyboard_layouts), with various, fancy calculations, it assigned QWERTY a base score of 3 and proceeded to compare other layouts, lower scores are better.\r\n\r\n * [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY): 3\r\n * [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard): 2.098\r\n * Workman: 1.993\r\n * [Capewell-Dvorak](http://www.michaelcapewell.com/projects/keyboard/index.htm#The_Capewell-Dvorak_Layout): 1.985\r\n * [Asset](http://millikeys.sourceforge.net/asset/): 1.894\r\n * Klausler: 1.867\r\n * [Colemak](http://colemak.com/): 1.842\r\n * [QGMLWY](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization): 1.670\r\n\r\nThe Carpalx study goes on to recommend other optimizations, supposedly scoring even better than Colemak. The clearest outcome from the study is that you can use almost any layout other than QWERTY and gain significant efficiencies in your finger travel. Most major operating systems have both Dvorak and Colemak built-in.\r\n\r\n### The Asset difference\r\n\r\nI theorize that users of alternative layouts are interested in dropping QWERTY because they have or are expecting to have repetitive stress injuries on using a keyboard. Certain realities of life come into play:\r\n\r\n * a **grid layout** like [TypeMatrix](http://typematrix.com/) is **not likely to be adopted** widely by computer manufacturers,\r\n * contoured keyboards like the [Kinesis](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm) are even less likely to be adopted widely,\r\n * keyboards with **cords are dinosaurs**,\r\n * **wireless keyboards** like the [FrogPad](http://www.frogpad.com/) with multiple parts **still require significant effort** to learn new typing formats,\r\n * **undo/copy/cut/paste, save, select all, and quit are common shortcuts**, which belong on the left hand and **are already in optimal locations**.\r\n\r\n## Supported platforms\r\n\r\nThis Github project offers Asset layout files for Mac OSX, Windows, Xorg, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris.","google":"UA-19336115-9"}
