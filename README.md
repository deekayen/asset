Asset keyboard layouts
========================

Asset keyboard layout (new) originally proposed by David Piepgrass at http://millikeys.sourceforge.net/asset/.

The files in the project at http://github.com/deekayen/asset for Mac and Xorg are by David Norman, but follow all the specifications outlined by David Piepgrass.

## Important design notes

David Piepgrass did not design any specification for international characters. Any implementation of deadkeys and international characters in this project was not defined by him. The international characters in Mac and Xorg created through deekayenâ€™s github repository are based on the U.S. layout files of their respective original platforms with positions shifted to match their base Asset key caps.
